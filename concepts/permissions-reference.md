# Microsoft Graph permissions reference

For your app to access data in Microsoft Graph, the user or administrator must grant it the correct permissions via a consent process. This topic lists the permissions associated with each major set of Microsoft Graph APIs. It also provides guidance about how to use the permissions.

[!INCLUDE [auth-use-least-privileged](../includes/auth-use-least-privileged.md)]

To learn more about how permissions work, see [Authentication and authorization basics](auth/auth-concepts.md#microsoft-graph-permissions), and watch the following video.

## Microsoft Graph permission names

Microsoft Graph permission names follow a simple pattern: _resource.operation.constraint_. For example, _User.Read_ grants permission to read the profile of the signed-in user, _User.ReadWrite_ grants permission to read and modify the profile of the signed-in user, and _Mail.Send_ grants permission to send mail on behalf of the signed-in user.

The _constraint_ element of the name determines the potential extent of access your app will have within the directory. Currently Microsoft Graph supports the following constraints:

* **All** grants permission for the app to perform the operations on all of the resources of the specified type in a directory. For example, _User.Read.All_ potentially grants the app privileges to read the profiles of all of the users in a directory.
* **Shared** grants permission for the app to perform the operations on resources that other users have shared with the signed-in user. This constraint is mainly used with Outlook resources like mail, calendars, and contacts. For example, _Mail.Read.Shared_, grants privileges to read mail in the mailbox of the signed-in user as well as mail in mailboxes that other users in the organization have shared with the signed-in user.
* **AppFolder** grants permission for the app to read and write files in a dedicated folder in OneDrive. This constraint is only exposed on [Files permissions](#files-permissions) and is only valid for Microsoft accounts.
* If **no constraint** is specified the app is limited to performing the operations on the resources owned by the signed-in user. For example, _User.Read_ grants privileges to read the profile of the signed-in user only, and _Mail.Read_ grants permission to read only mail in the mailbox of the signed-in user.

> [!NOTE]
> In delegated scenarios, your app's access is also limited by the privileges of the signed-in user. These privileges are determined by the user's assigned roles and their relationship to the data being accessed.
> For example, if the signed-in user doesn't have the appropriate privileges to view a file, then the client app won't be able to read that file either, even if the app is granted the `File.Read.All` delegated permission.

## Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts

Not all permissions are valid for both Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts. You can check the **Microsoft Account Supported** column for each permission group to determine whether a specific permission is valid for Microsoft accounts, work or school accounts, or both.

## Limits on requested permissions per app

Azure AD limits the number of permissions that can be requested and consented by a client app. These limits depend on the `signInAudience` value for your app, shown in the app's manifest. 

| signInAudience                     | Allowed users                                            | Maximum permissions the app can request   | Maximum Microsoft Graph permissions the app can request   | Maximum permissions that can be consented in a single request         |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AzureADMyOrg                       | Users from the organization where the app is registered  | 400                                       | 400                                                       | About 155 delegated permissions and about 300 application permissions |
| AzureADMultipleOrgs                | Users from any Azure AD organization                     | 400                                       | 400                                                       | About 155 delegated permissions and about 300 application permissions |
| PersonalMicrosoftAccount           | Consumer users (such as Outlook.com or Live.com accounts)  | 30                                        | 30                                                        | 30                                                                    |
| AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount | Consumer users and users from any Azure AD organization  | 30                                        | 30                                                        | 30                                                                    |

## Permissions availability status

Microsoft Graph permissions in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) are generally available and in GA status for all apps to use, except for a few sets that are in preview or private preview status. Permissions in preview are available to the public; they may change and may not be promoted to GA status. Permissions in private preview status are not and may never become available to the public. Do not use permissions in preview or private preview status in production apps.

## User and group search limitations for guest users in organizations

User and group search capabilities allow the app to search for any user or group in an organization's directory by performing queries against the `/users` or `/groups` resource set (for example, `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users`). Both administrators and users have this capability; however, guest users do not.

If the signed-in user is a guest user, depending on the permissions an app has been granted, it can read the profile of a specific user or group (for example, `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/241f22af-f634-44c0-9a15-c8cd2cea5531`); however, it cannot perform queries against the `/users` or `/groups` resource set that potentially return more than a single resource.

With the appropriate permissions, the app can read the profiles of users or groups that it obtains by following links in navigation properties; for example, `/users/{id}/directReports` or `/groups/{id}/members`.

## Limited information returned for inaccessible member objects

Container objects such as groups support members of various types, for example users and devices. When an application queries the membership of a container object and does not have permission to read a certain type, members of that type are returned but with limited information.  The application receives a 200 response and a collection of objects.  Complete information is returned for the object types that the application has permissions to read.  For the object types which the application does not have permission to read, only the the object type and ID are returned.

This is applied to all relationships that are of [directoryObject](/graph/api/resources/directoryobject) type (not just member links). Examples include `/groups/{id}/members`, `/users/{id}/memberOf` or `me/ownedObjects`.

For example, let's say an application has [User.Read.All](#user-permissions) and [Group.Read.All](#group-permissions) permissions for Microsoft Graph.  A group has been created and that group contains a user, a group, and a device.  The application calls [list group members](/graph/api/group-list-members).  The application has access to the user and group objects in the group, but not the device object.  In the response, all the selected properties of the user and group objects are returned. For the device object, however, only limited information is returned.  The data type and object ID are returned for the device, but all other properties have a value of *null*. Apps without permission will not be able to use the ID to get the actual object.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups/{id}/members?$select=id,displayName,description,createdDateTime,deletedDateTime,homepage,loginUrl HTTP/1.1
```

The following is the JSON response:

```json
{
"@odata.context":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#directoryObjects(id,displayName,description,createdDateTime,deletedDateTime,homepage,loginUrl)",
    "value":[
        {

### Remarks

> [!CAUTION]
> Permissions that allow granting authorization, such as _AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All_, allow an application to grant additional privileges to itself, other applications, or any user. Likewise, permissions that allow managing credentials, such as _Application.ReadWrite.All_, allow an application to act as other entities, and use the privileges they were granted. Use caution when granting any of these permissions.

The _Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy_ permission allows the same operations as _Application.ReadWrite.All_ except that the former allows these operations only on applications and service principals that the calling app is an owner of. Ownership is indicated by the `owners` navigation property on the target [application](/graph/api/application-list-owners?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [service principal](/graph/api/serviceprincipal-list-owners?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource.
> NOTE: Using the _Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy_ permission to call `GET /applications` to list applications will fail with a 403.  Instead use `GET servicePrincipals/{id}/ownedObjects` to list the applications owned by the calling application.

### Example usage

#### Delegated

* _Application.Read.All_: List all applications (`GET /v1.0/applications`)
* _Application.ReadWrite.All_: Update a service principal (`PATCH /v1.0/servicePrincipals/{id}`)

#### Application

* _Application.Read.All_: List all applications (`GET /v1.0/applications`)
* _Application.ReadWrite.All_: Delete a service principal (`DELETE /v1.0/servicePrincipals/{id}`)
* _Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy_: Create an application (`POST /v1.0/applications`)
* _Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy_: List all applications owned by the calling application (`GET /v1.0/servicePrincipals/{id}/ownedObjects`)
* _Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy_: Add another owner to an owned application (`POST /v1.0/applications/{id}/owners/$ref`).
    > NOTE: This may require additional permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> Before December 3rd, 2020, when the application permission *Device.ReadWrite.All* was granted, the [Device Managers](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#deprecated-roles) directory role was also assigned to the app's service principal. This directory role assignment is not removed automatically when the associated application permissions is revoked. To ensure that an application's access to read or write to devices is removed, customers must also remove any related directory roles that were granted to the application.
> 
> A service update disabling this behavior began rolling out on December 3rd, 2020. Deployment to all customers completed on January 11th, 2021. Directory roles are no longer automatically assigned when application permissions are granted.

They also exclusively control access to other directory resources like: [organizational contacts](/graph/api/resources/orgcontact?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [schema extension APIs](/graph/api/resources/schemaextension?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [Privileged Identity Management (PIM) APIs](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagement-root?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), as well as many of the resources and APIs listed under the **Azure Active Directory** node in the v1.0 and beta API reference documentation. These include administrative units, directory roles, directory settings, policy, and many more.

> Before December 3rd, 2020, when the application permission *Directory.Read.All* was granted, the [Directory Readers](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#directory-readers-permissions) directory role was also assigned to the app's service principal. When *Directory.ReadWrite.All* was granted, the [Directory Writers](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#directory-writers-permissions) directory role was also assigned. These directory roles are not removed automatically when the associated application permissions are revoked. To remove an application's access to read or write to the directory, customers must also remove any directory roles that were granted to the application.
> 
> A service update disabling this behavior began rolling out on December 3rd, 2020. Deployment to all customers completed on January 11th, 2021. Directory roles are no longer automatically assigned when application permissions are granted.

The _Directory.ReadWrite.All_ permission grants the following privileges:

- Full read of all directory resources (both declared properties and navigation properties)
- Create and update users
- Disable and enable users (but not Company Administrator)
- Set user alternative security ID (but not administrators)
- Create and update groups
- Manage group memberships
- Update group owner
- Manage license assignments
- Define schema extensions on applications
- Manage directory settings
- Manage admin consent workflow configuration (but not whether admin consent is required or who is authorized to grant admin consent)

> **Note**:
> - No rights to reset user passwords.
> - Updating another user's **businessPhones**, **mobilePhone**, or **otherMails** property is only allowed on users who are non-administrators or assigned one of the following roles: Directory Readers, Guest Inviter, Message Center Reader and Reports Reader. For more details, see Helpdesk (Password) Administrator in [Azure AD available roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles).  This is the case for apps granted either the User.ReadWrite.All or Directory.ReadWrite.All delegated or application permissions.
> - No rights to delete resources (including users or groups).
> - Specifically excludes create or update for resources not listed above. This includes: application, oAauth2Permissiongrant, appRoleAssignment, device, servicePrincipal, organization, domains, and so on.


### Example usage

#### Delegated

### Remarks

Group functionality is not supported on personal Microsoft accounts.

For Microsoft 365 groups, Group permissions grant the app access to the contents of the group; for example, conversations, files, notes, and so on.

For application permissions, there are some limitations for the APIs that are supported. For more information, see [known issues](known-issues.md).

In some cases, an app may need [Directory permissions](#directory-permissions) to read some group properties like `member` and `memberOf`. For example, if a group has a one or more [servicePrincipals](/graph/api/resources/serviceprincipal?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) as members, the app will need effective permissions to read service principals through being granted one of the _Directory.\*_ permissions, otherwise Microsoft Graph will return an error. (In the case of delegated permissions, the signed-in user will also need sufficient privileges in the organization to read service principals.) The same guidance applies for the `memberOf` property, which can return [administrativeUnits](/graph/api/resources/administrativeunit?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

To set a Microsoft 365 group's **preferredDataLocation** attribute, an app needs Directory.ReadWrite.All permission. When users in a multi-geo environment create a Microsoft 365 group, the **preferredDataLocation** value for the group is automatically set to that of the user. For more information about groups' preferred data location, see [Create a Microsoft 365 group with a specific PDL](/office365/enterprise/multi-geo-add-group-with-pdl).

Group permissions are used to control access to [Microsoft Teams](/graph/api/resources/teams-api-overview) resources and APIs. Personal Microsoft accounts are not supported.

Group permissions are also used to control access to [Microsoft Planner](/graph/api/resources/planner-overview) resources and APIs. Only delegated permissions are supported for Microsoft Planner APIs; application permissions are not supported. Personal Microsoft accounts are not supported.


### Example usage
#### Delegated

* _Group.Read.All_: Read all Microsoft 365 groups that the signed-in user is a member of (`GET /me/memberOf/$/microsoft.graph.group?$filter=groupTypes/any(a:a%20eq%20'unified')`).
* _Group.Read.All_: Read all Microsoft 365 group content like conversations (`GET /groups/{id}/conversations`).
* _Group.ReadWrite.All_: Update group properties, like photo (`PUT /groups/{id}/photo/$value`).
* _GroupMember.ReadWrite.All_: Update group members (`POST /groups/{id}/members/$ref`).
> **Note:**: This also requires _User.ReadBasic.All_ to read the user to add as a member.

#### Application

* _Group.Read.All_: Find all groups with name that starts with 'Sales' (`GET /groups?$filter=startswith(displayName,'Sales')`).
* _Group.ReadWrite.All_: Daemon service creates new events on a Microsoft 365 group's calendar (`POST /groups/{id}/events`).
* _Group.Create_: Creates a new group (`POST /groups`).

## OpenID Connect (OIDC) permissions

#### Delegated permissions

|   Permission    |  Display String   |  Description | Admin Consent Required | Microsoft Account supported |
|:----------------|:------------------|:-------------|:-----------------------|:--------------|

| _profile_ |    View users' basic profile | Allows the app to see your users' basic profile (name, picture, user name).| No | No |

#### Application permissions

None.

### Remarks
You can use these permissions to specify artifacts that you want returned in Azure AD authorization and token requests. They are supported differently by the Azure AD v1.0 and v2.0 endpoints.

With the Azure AD (v1.0) endpoint, only the _openid_ permission is used. You specify it in the *scope* parameter in an authorization request to return an ID token when you use the OpenID Connect protocol to sign in a user to your app. For more information, see [Authorize access to web applications using OpenID Connect and Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-openid-connect-code). To successfully return an ID token, you must also make sure that the _User.Read_ permission is configured when you register your app.

With the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint, you specify the _offline\_access_ permission in the _scope_ parameter to explicitly request a refresh token when using the OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect protocols. With OpenID Connect, you specify the _openid_ permission to request an ID token. You can also specify the _email_ permission, _profile_ permission, or both to return additional claims in the ID token. You do not need to specify _User.Read_ to return an ID token with the v2.0 endpoint. For more information, see [OpenID Connect scopes](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-scopes#openid-connect-scopes).

> **Important** The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) currently specifies _offline\_access_, _openid_, _profile_, and _email_ by default in authorization and token requests. This means that, for the default case, if you specify these permissions explicitly, Azure AD may return an error.

### Remarks

With the _User.Read_ permission, an app can also read the basic company information of the signed-in user for a work or school account through the [organization](/graph/api/resources/organization) resource. The following properties are available: id, displayName, and verifiedDomains.

For work or school accounts, the full profile includes all of the declared properties of the [User](/graph/api/resources/user) resource. On reads, only a limited number of properties are returned by default. To read properties that are not in the default set, use `$select`. The default properties are:

- displayName
- givenName
- jobTitle
- mail
- mobilePhone
- officeLocation
- preferredLanguage
- surname
- userPrincipalName

 _User.ReadWrite_ and _User.Readwrite.All_ delegated permissions allow the app to update the following profile properties for work or school accounts:

- aboutMe
- birthday
- hireDate
- interests
- mobilePhone
- mySite
- pastProjects
- photo
- preferredName
- responsibilities
- schools
- skills

With the _User.ReadWrite.All_ application permission, the app can update all of the declared properties of work or school accounts except for password.

With the _User.ReadWrite.All_ delegated or application permission, updating another user's **businessPhones**, **mobilePhone** or **otherMails** is only allowed on users who are non-administrators or assigned one of the following roles: Directory Readers, Guest Inviter, Message Center Reader and Reports Reader. For more details, see Helpdesk (Password) Administrator in [Azure AD available roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles).

To read or write direct reports (`directReports`) or the manager (`manager`) of a work or school account, the app must have either _User.Read.All_ (read only) or _User.ReadWrite.All_.

The _User.ReadBasic.All_ permission constrains app access to a limited set of properties known as the basic profile. This is because the full profile might contain sensitive directory information. The basic profile includes only the following properties:

- displayName
- givenName
- mail
- photo
- surname
- userPrincipalName

To read the group memberships of a user (`memberOf`), the app must have either [_Group.Read.All_](#group-permissions) or [_Group.ReadWrite.All_](#group-permissions). However, if the user also has membership in a [directoryRole](/graph/api/resources/directoryrole) or an [administrativeUnit](/graph/api/resources/administrativeunit?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), the app will need effective permissions to read those resources too, or Microsoft Graph will return an error. This means the app will also need [Directory permissions](#directory-permissions), and, for delegated permissions, the signed-in user will also need sufficient privileges in the organization to access directory roles and administrative units.

With the _User.ManageIdentities.All_ delegated or application permission, it is possible to update the identities (`identities`) of a user. This includes federated (or social identities) or local identities with email or name-based sign-in names.

### Example usage

#### Delegated

* _User.Read_: Read the full profile for the signed-in user (`GET /me`).
* _User.ReadWrite_: Update the photo of the signed-in user (`PUT /me/photo/$value`).
* _User.ReadBasic.All_: Find all users whose name starts with "David" (`GET /users?$filter=startswith(displayName,'David')`).
* _User.Read.All_: Read a user's manager (`GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/manager`).

#### Application

* _User.Read.All_: Read all users and relationships through delta query (`GET /beta/users/delta?$select=displayName,givenName,surname`).
* _User.ReadWrite.All_: Update the photo for any user in the organization (`PUT /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/photo/$value`).

For more complex scenarios involving multiple permissions, see [Permission scenarios](#permission-scenarios).

| _UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp_ |Read and write app activity to users' activity feed |Allows the app to read and report the signed-in user's activity in the app. |No | Yes |

#### Application permissions
None.

### Remarks
*UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp* is valid for both Microsoft accounts and work or school accounts.

The *CreatedByApp* constraint associated with this permission indicates the service will apply implicit filtering to results based on the identity of the calling app, either the MSA app id or a set of app ids configured for a cross-platform application identity.

### Example usage

#### Delegated
* _UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp_: Get a list of recent unique user activities based on associated history items published in the last day. (GET /me/activities/recent).
* _UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp_: Publish or update a user activity which may be resumed by the user of the application. (PUT /me/activities/%2Farticle%3F12345).
*	_UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp_: Publish or update a history item for a specified user activity in order to represent the period of user engagement. (PUT /me/activities/{id}/historyItems/{id}).
*	_UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp_: Delete a user activity in response to user initiated request or to remove invalid data. (DELETE /me/activities/{id}).
*	_UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp_: Delete a history item in response to user initiated request or to remove invalid data. (DELETE /me/activities/{id}/historyItems/{id}).

#### Application

* _WindowsUpdates.ReadWrite.All_: Create a deployment (`POST /beta/admin/windows/updates/deployments`).

## Permission scenarios

This section shows some common scenarios that target [user](/graph/api/resources/user) and [group](/graph/api/resources/group) resources in an organization. The tables show the permissions that an app needs to be able to perform specific operations required by the scenario. Note that in some cases the ability of the app to perform specific operations will depend on whether a permission is an application or delegated permission. In the case of delegated permissions, the app's effective permissions will also depend on the privileges of the signed-in user within the organization. For more information, see  [Delegated permissions, Application permissions, and effective permissions](auth/auth-concepts.md#microsoft-graph-permissions).

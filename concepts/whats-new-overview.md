# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.


## June 2023: New and generally available

### Application
Address an [application](/graph/api/resources/application) by a new alternate key, **appId**. The Azure portal refers to **appId** as the application (client) ID.

### Device and app management | Cloud printing
- [Get](/graph/api/print-list-recentshares) a list of [printer share](/graph/api/resources/printershare) resources recently used by the signed-in user.
- Get or update additional [printer share viewpoint](/graph/api/resources/printerShareViewpoint), which is [printer share](/graph/api/resources/printershare) data specific to the signed-in user.

### Search | Query
Optionally specify the sortable or refinable properties to collapse in the results of a [search request](/graph/api/resources/searchrequest).

To include multiple search requests in a single request body in the request body, [use the Microsoft Graph Search API to pass multiple search requests](/graph/search-concept-multiplerequest). 

Guest users can search for items within SharePoint or OneDrive that have been shared with them.
## June 2023: New in preview only

### Device and app management | Cloud PC
- [Running health checks for on premises network connection](/graph/api/cloudpconpremisesconnection-runhealthcheck?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) can now identify the following error conditions:

  - Your current network configuration does not allow the use of UDP direct connect Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN and TURN). 
  
  In either case, the condition does not prevent the use of Cloud PCs but can prevent optimal performance. Consider your own network configuration policies before you apply changes.

## Want to stay in the loop?

Here are some ways we can engage:

- Are there scenarios you'd like Microsoft Graph to support? Suggest and vote for new features at [Microsoft Feedback Portal](https://aka.ms/graphfeedback).
    Some new features originate as popular requests from the developer community. The Microsoft Graph team regularly evaluates customer needs and releases new features in the following order:

    1. Debut in **_preview_** status. Any related REST API updates are in the beta endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`).  

    2. Promoted to **_general availability_ (GA)** status, if sufficient feedback indicates viability. Any related REST API updates are added to the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`). 
- Be an active member in the Microsoft Graph community! [Join](https://aka.ms/m365-dev-call) the weekly Microsoft 365 platform community call.
- Sign up for the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program), get a free Microsoft 365 subscription, and start developing!

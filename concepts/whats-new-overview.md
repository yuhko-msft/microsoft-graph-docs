# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

- As part of managing corporate devices, Intune can now set additional properties on a [device](/graph/api/resources/device) used for multi-factor authentication in conditional access policies for an organization:  **deviceCategory**, **deviceOwnership**, **enrollmentProfileName**, and **registrationDateTime**.
- [Get](/graph/api/organization-get) organization details to identify the tenant type of an [organization](/graph/api/resources/organization) set up as a customer identity & access management (CIAM) solution. A CIAM tenant provides an integrated platform to serve consumers, partners, and citizen scenarios.
-  Define [custom security attribute](/graph/api/resources/customSecurityAttributeDefinition) resources to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control over specific Azure resources. For more information on defining and assigning your own custom security attributes, see [Overview of custom security attributes](/graph/api/resources/custom-security-attributes-overview).

## Want to stay in the loop?

Here are some ways we can engage:

- Are there scenarios you'd like Microsoft Graph to support? Suggest and vote for new features at [Microsoft Feedback Portal](https://aka.ms/graphfeedback).
    Some new features originate as popular requests from the developer community. The Microsoft Graph team regularly evaluates customer needs and releases new features in the following order:

    1. Debut in **_preview_** status. Any related REST API updates are in the beta endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`).  

    2. Promoted to **_general availability_ (GA)** status, if sufficient feedback indicates viability. Any related REST API updates are added to the v1.0 endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`). 
- Be an active member in the Microsoft Graph community! [Join](https://aka.ms/m365-dev-call) the weekly Microsoft 365 platform community call.
- Sign up for the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program), get a free Microsoft 365 subscription, and start developing!

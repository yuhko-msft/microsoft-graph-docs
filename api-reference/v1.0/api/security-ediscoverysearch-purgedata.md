- **Teams group chats** - Chat messages, posts, and attachments shared in a Teams conversation between three or more people. Also called *1:N* chats or *group conversations*.
- **Teams channels** - Chat messages, posts, replies, and attachments shared in a standard Teams channel.

- **Shared channels** - Message posts, replies, and attachments shared in a shared Teams channel.

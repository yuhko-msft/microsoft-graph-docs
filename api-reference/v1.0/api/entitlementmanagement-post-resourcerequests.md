# Create accessPackageResourceRequest

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [accessPackageResourceRequest](../resources/accesspackageresourcerequest.md) object to request the addition of a resource to an access package catalog, update of a resource, or the removal of a resource from a catalog.  A resource must be included in an access package catalog before a [role of that resource](../resources/accesspackageresourcerole.md) can be added to an access package.

To add an Azure AD group as a resource to a catalog, set the **requestType** to be `adminAdd`, and a `resource` representing the resource. The value of the **originSystem** property within the `resource` should be `AadGroup` and the value of the **originId** is the identifier of the group.  If using delegated permissions, the user requesting to add a group should be an owner of the group or in a directory role which allows them to modify groups. If using application permissions, the application requesting to add the group should also be assigned the `Group.ReadWrite.All` permission.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All  |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/resourceRequests
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required.  |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [accessPackageResourceRequest](../resources/accesspackageresourcerequest.md) object. Include the `accessPackageResource` relationship with an [accessPackageResource](../resources/accesspackageresource.md) object as part of the request.

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [accessPackageResourceRequest](../resources/accesspackageresourcerequest.md) object in the response body.

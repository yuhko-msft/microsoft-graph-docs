# driveItem: invite

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Adds one or more [permission](../resources/permission.md) objects to share a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) with each of the specified [driveRecipient](../resources/driverecipient.md) resource. Optionally sends an email or post to the recipients to notify them the sharing of the item.

A successful request sets properties of each **permission** requested on the **driveItem**. Among the properties is the **invitation** property which is a [sharingInvitation](../resources/sharinginvitation.md) resource representing the invitation facet of the permission.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## Request headers

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "scopes": "files.readwrite" } -->

```json
{
  "requireSignIn": false,
  "sendInvitation": false,
  "roles": [ "read | write"],
  "recipients": [
    { "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveRecipient" },
    { "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveRecipient" }
  ],
  "message": "string"
}
```

| Parameter        | Type                           | Description
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------
| recipients       | Collection([DriveRecipient][]) | A collection of recipients who will receive access and the sharing invitation.
| message          | String                         | A plain text formatted message that is included in the sharing invitation. Maximum length 2000 characters.
| requireSignIn    | Boolean                        | Specifies whether the recipient of the invitation is required to sign-in to view the shared item.
| sendInvitation   | Boolean                        | If true, a [sharing link][] is sent to each recipient. Otherwise, a permission is granted directly without sending a notification.
| roles            | Collection(String)             | Specify the roles that are to be granted to the recipients of the sharing invitation.
| expirationDateTime | DateTimeOffset                       | Specify the DateTime after which the permission expires. Available on OneDrive for Business, SharePoint, and premium personal OneDrive accounts.
| password           | String                         | The password set on the invite by the creator. Optional and OneDrive Personal only.

## Response
If successful, this method returns `200 OK` response code and a collection of [permission](../resources/permission.md) resources in the response body. Each **permission** resource corresponds with a single recipient in the `recipients` parameter.


## Example

This example sends a sharing invitation to a user with email address "ryan@contoso.com" with a message about a file being collaborated on.
The invitation grants Ryan read-write access to the file.

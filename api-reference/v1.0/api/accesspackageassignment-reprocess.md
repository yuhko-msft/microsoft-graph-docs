# accessPackageAssignment: reprocess

Namespace: microsoft.graph

In [Azure AD entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), callers can automatically reevaluate and enforce an [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) object of a userâ€™s assignments for a specific access package. The **state** of the access package assignment must be `Delivered` for the administrator to reprocess the user's assignment. Only admins with the Access Package Assignment Manager role, or higher, in Azure AD entitlement management can perform this action.

If successful, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code and reevaluates and enforces the user's assignments of the [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) object, meaning the status of the access package will be changed to Delivered. If the assignment doesn't exist, this method will return `404 Not Found` or if the **id** isn't valid, this method returns a `400 Bad Request` response code.

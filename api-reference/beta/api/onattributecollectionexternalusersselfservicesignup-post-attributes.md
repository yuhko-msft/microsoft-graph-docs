# Add attribute (to user flow)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add an attribute to an external identities self-service sign up user flow that's represented by an [externalUsersSelfServiceSignupEventsFlow](../resources/externalusersselfservicesignupeventsflow.md) object. You can add both custom and built-in attributes to a user flow.

Prior to this step, [PATCH the user flow](../api/authenticationeventsflow-update.md) to add the attribute to the attribute collection step (to determine how it will be displayed).

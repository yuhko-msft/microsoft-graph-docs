# Stage deletion of shift in draft mode

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Stage deletion of a [shift](../resources/shift.md) instance in a [schedule](../resources/schedule.md) in draft mode.
Consider a scenario where a manager has created a new shift and shared it with his team. Now the manager deleted this shift but has not yet shared this change. In this scenario, you can support a different view for the manager with this shift deleted, while the team member can still view the shared version of the shift.
Use this API to draft multiple shift deletions before finally sharing all the deleted shifts.

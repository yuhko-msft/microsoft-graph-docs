# Add includeApplication (to a user flow)
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add or link an application to an external identities self-service sign up user flow that's represented by an [externalUsersSelfServiceSignupEventsFlow](../resources/externalusersselfservicesignupeventsflow.md) object. This enables the authentication experience that's defined by the user flow to be enabled for the application. An application can only be linked to one user flow.

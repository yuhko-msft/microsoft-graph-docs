[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [threatintelligence-api-disclaimer](../../includes/threatintelligence-api-disclaimer.md)]

Organizations conducting threat infrastructure analysis and gathering threat intelligence can use [Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence](/defender/threat-intelligence/what-is-microsoft-defender-threat-intelligence-defender-ti) (Defender TI) to streamline triage, incident response, threat hunting, vulnerability management, and cyber threat intelligence analyst workflows. In addition, you can use the APIs exposed by Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence on Microsoft Graph to deliver world-class threat intelligence that helps protect your organization from modern cyber threats. You can identify adversaries and their operations, accelerate detection and remediation, and enhance your security investments and workflows.

These threat intelligence APIs allow you to operationalize intelligence found within the UI. This includes finished intelligence in the forms of articles and intel profiles, machine intelligence including indicators of compromise (IoCs) and reputation verdicts, and finally, enrichment data including passive DNS, cookies, components, and trackers.

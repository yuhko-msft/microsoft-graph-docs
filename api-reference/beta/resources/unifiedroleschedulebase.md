| :--------------- | :------------- | :------------------------ |
| appScopeId       | String         | Identifier of the app-specific scope when the assignment scope is app-specific. The scope of an assignment determines the set of resources for which the principal has been granted access. App scopes are scopes that are defined and understood by this application only. Use `/` for tenant-wide app scopes. Use **directoryScopeId** to limit the scope to particular directory objects, for example, administrative units or all users. |
| createdDateTime  | DateTimeOffset | Time that the schedule was created. |
| createdUsing     | String         | Identifier of the roleAssignmentScheduleRequest that created this schedule. |
| directoryScopeId | String         | Identifier of the directory object representing the scope of the assignment. The scope of an assignment determines the set of resources for which the principal has been granted access. Directory scopes are shared scopes stored in the directory that are understood by multiple applications. Use `/` for tenant-wide scope. Use **appScopeId** to limit the scope to an application only. |
| id               | String         | The unique identifier for the unifiedRoleAssignmentSchedule. Key, not nullable, Read-only. |
| modifiedDateTime | DateTimeOffset | Last time the schedule was updated. |
| principalId      | String         | Identifier of the principal to which the assignment is being granted to. Supports `$filter` (`eq`). |
| roleDefinitionId | String         | Identifier of the unifiedRoleDefinition the assignment is for. Read only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`). |
| status           | String         | Status for the `roleAssignmentSchedule`. It can include state related messages like `Provisioned`, `Revoked`, `Pending Provisioning`, and `Pending Approval`. Supports `$filter` (`eq`).  |

| directoryScope | [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md)                                 | Property referencing the directory object that is the scope of the assignment.

| roleDefinition | [unifiedRoleDefinition](../resources/unifiedroledefinition.md)                     | Property indicating the roleDefinition the assignment is for. Provided so that callers can get the role definition using `$expand` at the same time as getting the role assignment. roleDefinition.Id will be auto expanded. |

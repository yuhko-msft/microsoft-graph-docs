### Message event types

| Event type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| received | Message was received by the transport service. |
| sent | Message was sent between transport services. |
| delivered | Message was delivered to a local mailbox. |
| failed | Message delivery failed. A non-delivery report notification was sent. |
| processingFailed | The message can't be delivered or returned. |
| distributionGroupExpanded | A distribution group was expanded. |
| submitted | The Mailbox Transport Submission service successfully transmitted the message to the Transport service. |
| delayed | Message delivery was delayed. |
| redirected | Message was redirected to an alternative recipient after an Active Directory lookup. Redirect means the message was sent to a different recipient (either a redirection rule or a forwarding address). |
| resolved | Message's recipients were resolved to a different email address after an Active Directory lookup. Resolve means the message was sent to a proxy address and we rewrote that address to the user's primary address. E.g. if a user was sent to a mail contact, we updated the address to be their actual external email address. |
| dropped | Message was dropped without a delivery status notification (also known as a DSN), bounce message, or non-delivery report (NDR). For example, spam messages that were silently dropped without an NDR. |
| recipientsAdded | Recipients added as part of message delivery. |
| malwareDetected | Malware detected in the message. This will show as a failed message delivery with a Malware event. The Malware event contains information about which malware signature matched and the location of the malware. |
| malwareDetectedInMessage | Advanced Threat Protection detection of malware in message. |
| malwareDetectedInAttachment | Advanced Threat Protection detection of malware in attachments.  |
| ttZapped | Zero-Hour Auto Purge (ZAP) event. This implies the message has time traveled and verdict recharacterized to remove from mailbox. |
| ttDelivered | Dynamic Email delivery, message delivered as part of time travel. |
| spamDetected | The message has been characterized as spam. |
| transportRuleTriggered | A transport rule event occurred. |
| dlpRuleTriggered | A Data Loss Prevetion (DLP) policy rule triggered. |
| journaled | This event indicates the message was journaled via a journaling rule. Message journaling creates a copy and sends it to an alternate mailbox. |

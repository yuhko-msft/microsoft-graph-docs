# unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph 

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the instance for an active role assignment through Azure AD Privileged Identity Management. A **unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance** is created by [unifiedRoleAssignmentSchedule](unifiedroleassignmentschedule.md) and and represents an actual role assignment created through Privileged Identity Management. This resource supports the List and Get operations for the purpose of viewing current and future assignments.

Inherits from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md).

## Methods
|Method|Return type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|[List unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstances](../api/unifiedroleassignmentscheduleinstance-list.md)|[unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentscheduleinstance.md) collection|Get a list of the [unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentscheduleinstance.md) objects and their properties.|
|[Get unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance](../api/unifiedroleassignmentscheduleinstance-get.md)|[unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentscheduleinstance.md)|Read the properties and relationships of an [unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentscheduleinstance.md) object.|
|[filterByCurrentUser](../api/unifiedroleassignmentscheduleinstance-filterbycurrentuser.md)|[unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance](../resources/unifiedroleassignmentscheduleinstance.md) collection|Get a list of the [unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance](../resources/unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance.md) objects and their properties granted to a particular user.|

## Properties
|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|appScopeId|String|Identifier of the app-specific scope when the assignment scope is app-specific. The scope of an assignment determines the set of resources for which the principal has been granted access. App scopes are scopes that are defined and understood by this application only. Use `/` for tenant-wide app scopes. Use **directoryScopeId** to limit the scope to particular directory objects, for example, administrative units. Inherited from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md).|
|assignmentType|String|Type of the assignment. It can either be `Assigned` or `Activated`.|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Time that the schedule was created.|
|directoryScopeId|String|Identifier of the directory object representing the scope of the assignment. The scope of an assignment determines the set of resources for which the principal has been granted access. Directory scopes are shared scopes stored in the directory that are understood by multiple applications. Use `/` for tenant-wide scope. Use **appScopeId** to limit the scope to an application only. Inherited from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md)|
|endDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Time that the roleAssignmentInstance will expire|
|id|String|The unique identifier for the unifiedRoleAssignmentScheduleInstance. Key, not nullable, Read-only. Inherited from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md)|
|memberType|String|Membership type of the assignment. It can either be `Inherited`, `Direct`, or `Group`.|
|principalId|String|Identifier of the principal to which the assignment is being granted to. Can be a group or a user. Inherited from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md)|
|roleAssignmentOriginId|String|ID of the roleAssignment in the directory|
|roleAssignmentScheduleId|String|ID of the parent roleAssignmentSchedule for this instance|
|roleDefinitionId|String|Identifier of the unifiedRoleDefinition the assignment is for. Read only. Inherited from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md).  <br> Supports `$filter` (`eq`).|
|startDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Time that the roleAssignmentInstance will start|

## Relationships
|Relationship|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|activatedUsing|[unifiedRoleEligibilityScheduleInstance](../resources/unifiedroleeligibilityscheduleinstance.md)|If the roleAssignmentScheduleInstance is activated by a roleEligibilityScheduleRequest, this is the link to the related schedule instance.|
|appScope|[appScope](../resources/appscope.md)|Read-only property with details of the app specific scope when the assignment scope is app specific. Containment entity. Inherited from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md)|
|directoryScope|[directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md)|Property referencing the directory object that is the scope of the assignment. Provided so that callers can get the directory object using `$expand` at the same time as getting the role assignment. Read-only. Inherited from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md)|
|principal|[directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md)|Property referencing the principal that is getting a role assignment through the request. Provided so that callers can get the principal using `$expand` at the same time as getting the role assignment. Read-only. Inherited from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md)|
|roleDefinition|[unifiedRoleDefinition](../resources/unifiedroledefinition.md)|Property indicating the roleDefinition the assignment is for. Provided so that callers can get the role definition using `$expand` at the same time as getting the role assignment. roleDefinition.Id will be auto expanded. Inherited from [unifiedRoleScheduleInstanceBase](../resources/unifiedrolescheduleinstancebase.md)|

# unifiedRoleManagementPolicy resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

A unifiedRoleManagementPolicy specifies the various policies associated with a Azure AD scope and role definition. It is derived from [entity](entity.md). For policies that apply to Azure RBAC, use the [Azure REST PIM API for role management policies](/rest/api/authorization/role-management-policies).

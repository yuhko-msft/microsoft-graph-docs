|id|String|**TODO: Add Description** Inherited from [entity](../resources/entity.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceconfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceconfiguration.md)|
|deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode|[deviceManagementApplicabilityRuleDeviceMode](../resources/devicemanagementapplicabilityruledevicemode.md)|The device mode applicability rule for this Policy. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceconfiguration.md)|

|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/deviceconfiguration.md)|
|connectAutomatically|Boolean|Connect automatically when this network is in range. Setting this to true will skip the user prompt and automatically connect the device to Wi-Fi network.|
|connectWhenNetworkNameIsHidden|Boolean|When set to true, this profile forces the device to connect to a network that doesn't broadcast its SSID to all devices.|
|networkName|String|Network Name|
|ssid|String|This is the name of the Wi-Fi network that is broadcast to all devices.|
|wiFiSecurityType|androidWiFiSecurityType|Indicates whether Wi-Fi endpoint uses an EAP based security type. Possible values are: `open`, `wpaEnterprise`, `wpa2Enterprise`.|

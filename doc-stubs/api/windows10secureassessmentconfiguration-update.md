|assessmentAppUserModelId|String|Specifies the application user model ID of the assessment app launched when a user signs in to a secure assessment with a local guest account. Important notice: this property must be set with localGuestAccountName in order to make the local guest account sign-in experience work properly for secure assessments.|
|configurationAccount|String|The account used to configure the Windows device for taking the test. The user can be a domain account (domain\user), an AAD account (username@tenant.com) or a local account (username).|
|configurationAccountType|secureAssessmentAccountType|The account type used to by ConfigurationAccount. Possible values are: `azureADAccount`, `domainAccount`, `localAccount`, `localGuestAccount`.|
|launchUri|String|Url link to an assessment that's automatically loaded when the secure assessment browser is launched. It has to be a valid Url (http\[s\]://msdn.microsoft.com/).|
|localGuestAccountName|String|Specifies the display text for the local guest account shown on the sign-in screen. Typically is the name of an assessment. When the user clicks the local guest account on the sign-in screen, an assessment app is launched with a specified assessment URL. Secure assessments can only be configured with local guest account sign-in on devices running Windows 10, version 1903 or later. Important notice: this property must be set with assessmentAppUserModelID in order to make the local guest account sign-in experience work properly for secure assessments.|
